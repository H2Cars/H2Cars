                <strong> One of the biggest countries betting on Hydrogen-powered vehicles is China. </strong>Because of its large reliance on internation oil supplies to power gasoline or diesel vehicles, the Chinese government is largely subsidizing development projects for fuel cell vehicles. It is estimated that China spent around USD12.4 Billion $ in 2018 on subsidies to develop hydrogen cars. This is done in an attempt to reach the country's goal of 1 million fuel cell vehicles by 2030, even though predictions based on the current state of development are closer to 2 million by 2030, which would amount to 5% of the country's vehicle fleet. Thanks to these huge amounts of subsidies, car manufacturers are guaranteed a profit on their fuel cell vehicles, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of companies working on hydrogen-powered cars.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Similarly, South Korea announced on January 17, 2019, its economic plan for the development of a Hydrogen economy. </strong>Among other things, the government has announced that it aims to increase the number of Hydrogen-powered vehicles to 6.2 million by 2040 and the number of charging stations to 1,200, thus creating 420,000 jobs. This radical -if not too ambitious- plan is based on environmental and economic factors: South Korea aims to reduce its carbon emissions while its economy benefits from selling South Korean hydrogen-powered cars. Finally, such a large investment could increase sales of Hydrogen-powered cars, which would in turn greatly lower the cost of fuel-cell vehicles, making them more accessible to all.&nbsp;</p><p>On a much smaller scale, the French government announced a plan to invest one hundred million euros in Hydrogen in an ambition "to make France a world leader in this technology", as said ex-French ecology minister Nicolas Hulot. Once again, the motivation behind this is to lower carbon emissions. Amongst other things, This plan aims to set up 100 H2 refueling stations in France by 2023 and 1000 by 2028</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Japan has immensely invested on the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games to show the world the advantages of hydrogen.</strong> To counteract the carbon emissions caused by major sporting events like the olympics, Japan decided to use many renewables and hydrogen. Compared to London's 3.45million metric tons and Rio de Janeiro's 3.56million metric tons of CO2 emissions created during Olympic Games, Tokyo plans to emit only 3.01million metric tons. For comparison, a conventional car emits 4.6 metrics tons per year. Assuming that Olympic Games last a month, this would be the equivalent of 7.9 million cars running for a month. Tokyo also plans to showcase a fleet of hydrogen cars, as well as power the athlete village with hydrogen. Japan wants to test if it can truly become a hydrogen society.</p><p><strong>Regarding Japan again, Toyota is planning on mass producing</strong> its fuel cells and storage tanks. It expects that by 2020, it should have sold over 30,000 FCEVs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Other developments include things like</strong> hydrogen trains (e.g. Alstrom), or development funds by the UK governement that plan to cut down hydrogen costs(£20 million fund). Also, hydrogen can be obtained as the byproduct of industrial processes and be used for industrial purposes or can be sold to refueling stations. Companies like Ineos (chlor-alkali production) are doing exactly this by collecting leftover Hydrogen from their processes. In addit<span style="font-size: 1rem;">ion, the hydrogen council even believes that by 2030, 230–250TWh of surplus wind and solar energy could be converted into H2. Indeed, the future does look bright for the production of H2 through renewable energy. For instance, tidal energy could be used to constantly generate H2. However, hydrogen is currently being produced almost always through natural gas
 reforming, which is a problem of hydrogen cars today in terms of the environment, but it presents an advantage economically. If the market decides to opt in for cheap hydrogen created through natural gas reforming, this would advantageous economically although its environmental impact is debatable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
