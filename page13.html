For example,  the <a href="page10.html">Toyota Mirai</a>, a hydrogen car, has an MSRP listed at $59,260 or 52,036€.  According to Gallup [<a href="page11.html">1</a>], France's median household income in Int$(PPP) was 31,112 per year (as of 2013), making the cost of the Toyota Mirai 190% more than the annual income of a typical  French household. 
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">To more fully understand why  hydrogen cars, such as the Mirai, cost so much, we must look at the components  of hydrogen vehicles.&nbsp;</span></p><div><br></div><p></p></div>

                    <li><strong>Fuel Cell Stacks: </strong>As mentioned previously, (<a href="page7.html">Fuel Cell Stacks</a>), hydrogen vehicles typically use platinum as the catalyst for splitting Hydrogen and Oxygen. Platinum is a rare element, and as such, the cost of supplying a primary vehicle component which is core to its operation is (and will likely continue to be) expensive compared with the cost of supplying a catalyst as part of the manufacture of a standard car (i.e., one relying upon fossil fuels).  Indeed, the worldwide supplies of platinum do not meet current demand.   According to Statista [2], in 2017, 200 metric tons of platinum were mined, while  global demand for platinum  was 215 metric tons as of 2015. With demand outstripping the supply of platinum,  the net impact is high prices for platinum. 
</li><li>However, at the current time, replacing platinum with any other alternative metal would result in a less efficient catalyst ( and slower reactions). This is due to   the way hydrogen binds with platinum. H2(g) adsorbs to platinum, which will then break the H2 bond, forming a H-Pt bond; this, in turn, makes it easier for the H atoms to lose their electron and form H+ ions.  Based on research and development of hydrogen vehicles to date, platinum is the best catalyst  because of the way it adsorbs H2 and the fact that it also releases the products, which create a higher rate of free electrons. Indeed, the use of platinum in fuel cells is an expensive approach.  However, there is some reason for hope, given the innovation of car manufacturers who have developed some solutions to address the issue associated with reliance upon an expensive component, platinum. In the near future, we can expect these manufacturers to use significantly less platinum to bring down their fixed costs. For example, Daimler’s Mercedes GLC F-Cell used 90% less platinum than its predecessor model, the B-Class F-Cell. Other research &amp; development firms are actively seeking to make cheaper catalysts for hydrogen vehicles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Components solely present in hydrogen cars: </strong><a href="page8.html">Other components</a> in a hydrogen car are not as expensive (compared to similar components for traditional fossil fuel vehicles), as they do not hold as many expensive rare materials. However, even taking into these equalizing factors,  hydrogen cars cannot be manufactured at the same cost basis as traditional markets because these vehicles are not yet in the “mass market.”  These costs are reflected by the production of these other components that are not mass produced and are unique to hydrogen cars, which makes them more expensive. This is the principle of economies of scale, where price is dictated by the efficiency defined by the size or speed of an operation. In the case of hydrogen cars, these vehicles are not mass produced - 6,475 fuel cell vehicles have been sold this century, whereas 1,000,000 lithium-ion battery cars were sold in 2017 and 88.1 million traditional fossil fuel cars were sold in 2016; so respecting this concept of economies of scale, the other components cost a lot more than if they were mass produced.&nbsp;</li>
